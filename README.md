# Delta Path Planning
Path planning and generation tooling for the delta robot.

## Usage & Background

Run `total-perspective-vortex` from the command line, with the working directory containing folders for each frame of the animation.

For each frame folder in the working directory, the tool:

- Finds and ingests the `.json` file generated by a Blender plugin representing a spline
- Deserialises the `json` file, applies corrections and scaling, and prepares a list of splines suitable for execution by `zaphod-bot`.
- Finds and ingests the `.png` files which contains the UV map for the spline.
- Prepares a set of LED animations in HSV space which `zaphod-bot` can use to light paint.
- Writes a file inside the directory which is ready for execution with the `delta-ui` event mode.

# Creating splines in Blender

Using 2.79.

1. Create a project/scene.
2. In lower bar, Add -> NURBS Curve
3. Modify the control points in 3D space, add more points with the "Extrude" button in the sidebar.
4. To manipulate points, right click on the point to select it, then drag.
5. In the right-hand sidebar, select the NURBS curve, click the object data button (looks like a curve) 
6. Increase the resolution to some minimum amount (like 4). Add Bevel Depth (something like 0.001).
7. In the materials tab, add a new material. Add surface emission (white or whatever), and volume (emission) might be needed?
8. Render with Cycles, and you should see white lines following the spline.

A pair of simplistic examples are in the `/assets` for reference.
